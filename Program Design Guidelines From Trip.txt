Program Design Guidelines: From Triphasic

1) High volume: The total weight lifted per session or workout
2) High intensity: The percentage of an athlete’s maximum lift during a workout
3) High frequency: The number of times the athlete trains per week
4) High expectations: The expectations of the athlete (missed workouts, skipped sets, or 
failed reps are unacceptable)
5) Overreaching: The point the athlete is pushed to but not past (adrenal fatigue)
6) Classic Undulating Model:
    a. Intensity Increase throughout the week
    b. Volume Decreases throughout the week
    c. Middle of week intensity/ volume close
7) Modified Undulating Model: 
    a: Monday M-Intensity, Wednesday H-    Intensity, Friday H-Volume
8) Look At stress by total weight lifted in lbs
9) Sequence of training block parameters
	1) General Fitness
	2) Maximal Strength
	3) Strength endurance & Power
	4) Maximal Speed
10) Elite 20k lbs a day of volume vs 2k lbs a day
11) 2-6 weeks for each training block
12) Triphasic M82-87%,W90-97%,F75-80%
13) Complex method: When applying the complex method, an athlete would perform a heavy compound exercise 
(typically using loads greater than 80 percent of a 1RM) followed by a plyometric jump exercise 
that mimics the same motor pattern
14)On the other hand, contrast training is defined as performing a maximal or near maximal lift (80–
97 percent) followed by a drop set performed at 50–70 percent of the 1RM
15) French contrast method is the combination of the complex and contrast 
methods outlined above. It consists of four exercises—a heavy compound exercise (80–90 
percent 1RM), a plyometric jump, a drop set or weighted jump (30 percent 1RM), and a 
plyometric or accelerated plyometric
16) Always finish an ECC lift with Explosive Movement
17) Oscillatory Quick on/off training,Short and quick reps
